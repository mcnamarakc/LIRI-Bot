# LIRI-Bot

Liri is a command-line application that can generate information about songs, touring artist shows, and movies. 

Developed using Spotify API, IMDB API and Bands in Town API, users can call the following commands to retrieve information:
            node liri.js concert-this artist name,
            node liri.js movie-this movie name,
            node liri.js spotify-this-song song name
